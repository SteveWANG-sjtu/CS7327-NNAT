# Addressing Two-spiral Classification Problem with MLQP and MinMax Models

This is the first assignment of course CS7327, which focuses on Back Propagation (BP) algorithm and nonlinear 
classification with Multilayer Quadratic Perceptron (MLQP). 

In this project, we will:
- model MLQP layer with `Numpy` package in Python;
- apply MLQP models to classify two-spiral problem;
- solve two-spiral problem with Min-Max modular network;
- further compare our implementation with the deep learning library.

## Setup environment
- Please first setup environment from file `requirements.txt`

## Classification with MLQP
- To setup an experiment, please run the script `run_mlqp.sh`.

## Classification with MinMax Modular Network
- To setup an experiment, please run the script `run_minmax.sh`.

## Comparison with PyTorch Library
- To setup an experiment with `PyTorch` Library, please run the script `run_torch.sh`.
